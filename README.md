I think it would be super cool if they had a [contest](http://nerdyshow.com/contests/) for web designers, web developers, and ~~dungeon~~ web masters to create a sexy new website for nerdy.fm using the :sparkles:magic:sparkles: of GitHub! In a nutshell, participants would [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) this repository, make their changes, and submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).

:bulb: Are you a software developer? Get in the zone by blaring this Nerdy FM on your headpones. Your code will be 900-1200 times better, stronger, faster.
